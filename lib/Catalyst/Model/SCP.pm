    __PACKAGE__->config( 'Model::MYSCP' => {
            host => '1.2.3.4',
            user => 'user',
            identity_file => '/home/user/.ssh/id_rsa',
            net_scp_options => {

Create your model class

    package TestApp::Model::MYSCP;

    use 5.006;
    use strict;
    use warnings;

    use parent 'Catalyst::Model::SCP';

In your catalyst application

    my $scp_client = $c->model('MYSCP');

    my $success = $scp_client->is_connection_success;
    warn 'SCP connection is good.' if $success;

    my $success = $scp_client->put_file('local_file.txt','destination.txt');
    warn 'File uploaded successfully' if $success;

    my $success = $scp_client->download_file('destination.txt','local_file.txt');
    warn 'File downloaded successfully' if $success;

=head1 SUBROUTINES/METHODS

=head2 is_connection_success

C<is_connection_success()> - Returns true when it able to make connection using specified credentials.

=cut

has is_connection_success => (
    isa => 'Bool',
    is => 'ro',
    lazy_build => 1
);
sub _build_is_connection_success {
    my $self = shift;
    my ($fh, $filename) = tempfile();
    my $status = $self->put_file( $filename, '/home/'.$self->user.'/scp_connection_test' );
    return $status;
}

=head2 put_file

C<put_file(LOCALFILE, REMOTEPATH)> - Transfer local file to the remote path.
                 Local file should have absolute path.
                 Remote file is the location on the remote server, no need to specify username, like normal scp.

=cut

sub put_file {
    my( $self, $file, $destination ) = @_;
    if ( not -f $file ){
        warn "$file does not exist";
        return 0;
    }
    my $scp_client = $self->net_scp;
    my $status = 0;
    eval {
        $status = $scp_client->scp($file,$destination);
    };
    if ($@) {
        warn $@;
    }
    return $status;
}

=head2 download_file

C<download_file(REMOTEFILE, LOCALPATH)> - Download remote file to local path.
                 Local file should have absolute path.
                 Remote file is the location on the remote server, no need to specify username, like normal scp.

=cut

    my( $self, $destination, $file ) = @_;
    if ( not -e $file ){
        warn "$file does not exist";
        return 0;
    }
    my $scp_client = $self->net_scp;
    my $status = 0;
    eval {
        my $destination_string = $self->user . '@' . $self->host .':'. $destination;
        $status = $scp_client->scp($destination_string,$file);
    };
